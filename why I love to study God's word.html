                    I love the Bible! For more than 35 years now, I’ve been studying God’s Word, and it has drastically changed my life. It’s been the key to radical transformation in my perspectives and attitudes, and God has healed and restored my spirit, soul and body
                    through the power in His Word.
                    <br><br> God is a God of restoration and wholeness. We see it all throughout the Bible. John 3:16 says, God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting
                    life (NKJV). Second Corinthians 5:17 says that as new creations in Christ, old things have passed away; behold all things have become new, and verse 21 says we become the righteousness of God in Christ.

                    <br><br>
                    <span class="sub-content-heading">Getting Back What Was Lost I love what Luke 19:10 says:</span> The Son of Man came to seek and to save that which was lost. Notice this doesn’t say “who was lost,” but “that which was lost.” Jesus
                    came to save us from our sins and to restore whatever was lost. It could be the scars of childhood, something you missed out on, something that was stolen from you… Whatever needs to be restored to wholeness spiritually, mentally,
                    emotionally and physically, Jesus can bring healing to that part of your life.

                    <br><br> One of my favorite scriptures is John 10:10, which says that the thief comes only in order to steal and kill and destroy. I came that they may have and enjoy life, and have it in abundance (to the full, till it overflows).
                    This shows us that God wants us to enjoy our lives, and Jesus came to give us abundant life. And John 1:4 says, In [Jesus] was Life, and the Life was the Light of men.

                    <br> <br>
                    <span class="sub-content-heading">Redefining Life</span> The Greek word for Life is Zoe, which means “life as God has it.” Think about that: life as God has it. What does it mean? Is God worried? Is He anxious about anything that’s
                    happening in the world? Is He frightened? No! God is perfect and holy. He is always peaceful, joyful and confident. And He wants us to have this life through our relationship with Christ.
