                            If you have become an expert in your work, how you would feel if someone younger and less experienced were chosen to take up your role? Moses had led God’s people out of Egypt and across the Red Sea (Exodus 1-15). He had received God’s law and taught
                            it to the people (Exodus 20-50), and by God’s grace he had brought them to the edge of the promised land. But the people had rebelled, and God had turned them back to wander in the wilderness for forty years (Numbers 13-14).
                            Now they were about to enter the promised land again, but Moses would not be leading them in. God had chosen Joshua to do that instead.
